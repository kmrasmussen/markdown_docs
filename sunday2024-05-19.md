Understanding what human happiness is very difficult.
It seems clear that motivation is a factor.
I believe motivation is usefully analysed from the perspective of hierarchical task structures. However such a view has to be complemented with viewing human motivation and execution from a perspective where a strong hierarchical task structure is precisely missing because it is subsumed into a general feeling of what needs to be done which can maybe be usefully analysed using the terminology of value functions from reinforcement learning.

## Ideas about non-structured motivation
We are born with relatively innate biological neural mechanisms that assign reward to specific states and actions. Given our cognitive capabilities and planning abilities we are able to imagine certain states of the world and our life quite far ahead. The innate biological neural mechanisms allow us to asign value to these states and compare the value of different states of affairs.

Through our cognitive learning abilities as we grow and experience the world our system forms new models of what is valuable that is not directly innate. Still it is to be expected that in many cases, what these models value is still heavily influenced by the innate value evaluations: They are contextualizations of the innate value evalutations. As an example, there is most likely an innate valuing of companionship and being integrated in a social structure. A person might experience that playing music in a band is a way of connecting with other people, gradually changes to valuations will occur where playing music in a band is viewed as immediately rewarding, and not only the act but the thought of it.

The neural learning of derived valuing is important for acting in the world. It is related to the credit assignment problem of reinforcment learning. In order to succesfully learn RL policies reward needs to be non-sparse. This is not to say that the innate biological valuing is especially sparse; however, it does not allow for intelligent planning at a higher level. Biological valuing evaluates states according to things such as pain, hunger, sexual gratification etc. In order for human being to be adaptive in the human environment it needs to be able to do things and reach states of the world that are not easily reachable by following the most direct route of immediate biologically valued reward. Sacrificing immediate reward. It seems that learned valuing allows for this in a different way: The reward system couples to the learned features available from the perceptual system.

## Ideas about structured motivation
We have bounded short-term memory. It may or may not be that short-term memory is a natural kind of human psychology, I have not read enough about studies but I get the impression that people think there are probably different circuits and that it is not entirely a continuum. It would be tempting to think that it is a continuum though.

The short-term memory I am thinking about here is not exactly working memory, but in some sense there must be some limitations on how complex the hierarchical structures of action we need to perform can be active in memory. This is why many of us use to-do lists and other externalized tools to aid our memory in solving a task.

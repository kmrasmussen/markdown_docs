# Streamlining Delivery: A Comprehensive Overview of the Work Packages

In this blog post, we’ll walk you through the comprehensive planning involved in developing a delivery management system. This will be structured into various work packages, each addressing a specific aspect of the system's requirements. 

### 1. GetRouteSearch: Efficient Route Planning

**Objective**: Develop backend functionality to provide three types of routes for a specified delivery query—fastest, cheapest, and recommended.

**Requirements**:
- **Cheapest Route**: Combines internal and external routes to find the most cost-effective path.
- **Fastest Route**: Uses internal routes to deliver the quickest option.
- **Recommended Route**: A balanced option, optimized for various conditions such as route reliability and cost.
- **Additional Information**: Initially considered live animal delivery with extra fees, but this was subsequently discarded.

**Expected Output**: Delivery query results showing three potential routes: fastest, cheapest, and recommended.

### 2. CreateDeliveryFrontendForm: Ease of Order Creation

**Objective**: Create a frontend form for initiating deliveries.

**Requirements**:
- **Fields Needed**:
  - Source
  - Destination
  - Route Selection (fastest, cheapest, recommended)
  - Dispatch Time
  - Cost (original and with any applicable fees)
  - Importance of the parcel

**Expected Output**: A user-friendly form to facilitate the creation of delivery orders.

---

### 3. CreateDeliveryBackend Method: Backend Order Processing

**Objective**: Backend method to handle delivery creation, receiving input from the frontend form.

**Requirements**:
- Process input from the frontend.
- Compute remaining delivery details like estimated time of delivery.
- Assign and register employee handling the parcel.
- Validate the parcel details.
- Insert valid parcels into the database, return errors for invalid entries.

**Expected Output**: A robust backend method ensuring smooth order creation and registration.

### 4. ViewParcelDelivery: Comprehensive Tracking

**Objective**: Develop both frontend and backend components for viewing parcel delivery status.

**Requirements**:
- **Frontend**:
  - Display all available delivery information from the database.
  - Ensure the page is accessible only when logged in.
  - Include a QR code for easy tracking.

**Expected Output**: A detailed tracking page for users to view delivery statuses.

---

### 5. OnlyCEOAccessiblePage: Secure Admin Access

**Objective**: Create a page restricted to admin (CEO) access.

**Requirements**:
- The page should be accessible only by the CEO.
- No specific content required in this work package.

**Expected Output**: Secure admin-only page ensuring restricted access.

---

### 6. ColorThemeAndLogo: Aesthetic Consistency

**Objective**: Apply the mockup color theme and logo across the platform.

**Requirements**:
- Implement the color theme and logo as per mockups.
- Ensure the logo links back to the front page when clicked.

**Expected Output**: Visually appealing and consistent interface.

---

### 7. GraphAndExportPage: Data Visualization

**Objective**: Create a page to visualize data through graphs and enable CSV export.

**Requirements**:
- **Graph**: 
  - No backend connection needed.
  - Use JavaScript to create graphs with fake data.
- **Button**:
  - Enable export of data as a CSV file.
  - Utilize base64 encoding for data export.

**Expected Output**: A functional page displaying graphs and enabling CSV export.

---

### 8. ListPage: Delivery Overview

**Objective**: Backend functionality to list all deliveries.

**Requirements**:
- Retrieve and display all registered deliveries on the frontend.
- No pagination needed.

**Expected Output**: A comprehensive list of all deliveries.

# LLM Commentary on Delivery System Development

This commentary provides expert insights and responses to the various points raised in the project's transcript. Let's dive into each work package and address specific concerns and suggested improvements.

### 1. GetRouteSearch: Efficient Route Planning

**Transcript Insight**: "How many hours do we have to wait for this? I think that's probably eight or... Only eight?"

- **Commentary**: The timeline for developing the GetRouteSearch functionality depends heavily on the complexity of integrating internal and external routes. Consider breaking this task into smaller sub-tasks and performing incremental testing. Start with internal routes before adding external ones to ensure each part functions correctly.

**Transcript Insight**: "There is a cheapest route and that this route uses both internal and external routes."

- **Commentary**: Be cautious with integrating external routes as they might have different API response times and reliability. Ensure you have fallback mechanisms and timeouts to handle external API failures gracefully.

### 2. CreateDeliveryFrontendForm: Ease of Order Creation

**Transcript Insight**: "There should be fields for the following: source, destination, ... and that's it."

- **Commentary**: For better user experience, consider adding validation on input fields to ensure the source and destination are valid locations. Additionally, use auto-complete functionality for location fields to reduce user input errors.

### 3. CreateDeliveryBackend Method: Backend Order Processing

**Transcript Insight**: "It should also specify which employee has registered this parcel and perform validation."

- **Commentary**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized employees can register parcels. When performing validation, use a validation framework to ensure consistency and reduce errors.

**Transcript Insight**: "...if it returns an error if it is invalid."

- **Commentary**: Clearly define what constitutes an invalid parcel. Use descriptive error messages to help users or employees understand and correct the problem.

### 4. ViewParcelDelivery: Comprehensive Tracking

**Transcript Insight**: "The frontend should display all the information available in the database to the user."

- **Commentary**: Ensure sensitive information is not exposed to unauthorized users. Implement data filtering based on user roles to enhance security and privacy.

**Transcript Insight**: "There should also be a QR code."

- **Commentary**: Use a library like `qrcode.js` to generate QR codes dynamically. Ensure the QR code contains essential tracking information and is scannable under various conditions (e.g., print, mobile screens).

### 5. OnlyCEOAccessiblePage: Secure Admin Access

**Transcript Insight**: "It should not have any specific content, that is another work package."

- **Commentary**: Even though the current content is minimal, prioritize securing the page using robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as OAuth or JWT tokens.

### 6. ColorThemeAndLogo: Aesthetic Consistency

**Transcript Insight**: "Make it look like on the mockups that we have made and to get the logo on to the site."

- **Commentary**: Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind for consistency with the mockups. Ensure the logo is in a high-resolution format, and provide responsive design so it scales correctly on different devices.

### 7. GraphAndExportPage: Data Visualization

**Transcript Insight**: "Use ChatGPT to find out how you can make a graph using JavaScript only and display it."

- **Commentary**: Consider using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for creating graphs. These libraries are well-documented and provide robust functionalities for interactive and customizable charts.

**Transcript Insight**: "Use base64 encoding for data export."

- **Commentary**: Use the `Blob` API in JavaScript to create the CSV file and `URL.createObjectURL` for downloading. This method is more straightforward and doesn't require base64 encoding, which simplifies the process.

### 8. ListPage: Delivery Overview

**Transcript Insight**: "It does not need to include pagination."

- **Commentary**: Even though pagination isn't required now, consider implementing it if the list grows large. Use infinite scrolling or traditional pagination to enhance performance and user experience.

## Conclusion

This detailed commentary addresses specific points from the transcript and offers practical solutions. Each recommendation aims to streamline the workflow, improve robustness, ensure security, and enhance the user experience.

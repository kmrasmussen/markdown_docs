# The Phenomenology of Being Drunk: A Year Later

It's been a year since I last consumed alcohol. Tonight, I broke that fast, and I find myself once again under its spell. The experience of being drunk is both fascinating and perplexing—an altered state that has been richly documented in literature, film, and common lore. This blog post aims to explore the intellectual and introspective dimensions of drunkenness, delving into its phenomenology, cognitive effects, and social implications.

## Understanding Drunkenness

The science of alcohol's impact on the brain is not entirely clear. While the physiological changes and the numbing effects are well-documented, the subjective experience remains elusive. Being drunk alters one's sensory perception and behavior. For example, I found myself wandering aimlessly in search of a place to urinate, almost choosing an inappropriate spot out of sheer carelessness.

This shift in behavior points to a larger cognitive phenomenon. Drunkenness induces a high-energy state in the brain, paradoxically paired with a numbing effect. This duality enables a certain level of intellectual openness and social extroversion that is otherwise inhibited. In this state, I engaged in conversations that reached lofty levels of abstraction and profundity—discussions I would typically shy away from.

## Cognitive and Social Shifts

Alcohol simplifies the affordances of attention, making one more present-focused. Conversations become engrossing, yet there is an awareness of other potential social interactions. This leads to a dance of exiting and entering conversations, sometimes skillfully, other times awkwardly. 

The brain's state maintenance, usually a subtle undercurrent of motivations and decisions, becomes simplified. Concerns that typically occupy the mind recede, replaced by a carefree attitude. This simplification is not just a numbing of worry, but a reorientation toward the present moment.

## The Energetic Increase and Cognitive Disinhibition

Drunkenness brings with it a motivation fueled by increased energy levels, but this energy is less about executing tasks and more about social and intellectual engagement. One feels a compulsion to interact, joke, and explore ideas—abilities that seem enhanced, although they may be simply exercised with more freedom due to reduced inhibitions.

## The Verbal Fluency Debate

While under the influence, I pondered whether my verbal fluency had increased. Was I more articulate, or merely verbose? The distinction is blurred, much like the effects of alcohol on cognitive function. Despite this uncertainty, the desire to communicate and connect remains strong.

## The Purpose of Drunkenness

Why did I choose to drink tonight? Part of it was to explore whether I was missing out on anything by abstaining. Alcohol can disinhibit social interactions, making it easier to form new connections. This effect counters the often inaccurate assumption that social bonds are fixed, an assumption rooted in social anxiety.

## Defocusing on the Future

Alcohol also diminishes long-term concerns. Matters like career goals, personal relationships, and self-actualization—constantly managed by the brain—become less pressing. This reduction in future-oriented thinking allows for a more present-focused experience, a phenomenon also observed in psychedelic use and deep meditation.

## The Question of Worth

Is it worth being drunk? The downsides of alcohol are well-known: high calorie content, potential for addiction, cognitive impairment, and health risks such as cancer. Yet, some argue that the social benefits—forming deeper connections and breaking down social barriers—justify occasional indulgence.

On the other hand, one could adopt a mindfulness-based approach to achieve similar social fluency without the physiological drawbacks of alcohol. By increasing metabolic efficiency, confidence, and baseline happiness, one can attain the beneficial effects of drunkenness naturally.

## Conclusion

In the end, the decision to drink or abstain hinges on one's priorities. If maintaining a controlled, healthy lifestyle is paramount, avoiding alcohol entirely may be the best course. However, if social engagement and occasional carefree enjoyment hold significant value, moderate alcohol use could be justified.

For now, I'll continue to reflect on tonight's experiences, balancing the insights gained with the awareness of alcohol's risks. Whether or not I choose to drink again, this evening has provided a rich field for introspection and an understanding of the complex interplay between mind, social behavior, and substance use.

# LLM Commentary on Drunkenness Transcript

## Introduction

In this post, I'll provide a deeper analysis and commentary on specific points raised in the transcript regarding the experience of being drunk. This includes clarifying cognitive effects, addressing social implications, and correcting potential misconceptions.

## The Cognitive Changes

### Phenomenological Changes

> "The science of being drunk is not understood sufficiently, by that I mean the treatment of the changes to the brain. And the subjective effects have been richly described in literature and cinema..."

Alcohol affects neurotransmitter systems by influencing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, which are inhibitory, and glutamate receptors, which are excitatory. The balance between inhibition and excitation explains why one might feel both energetic and numb simultaneously. 

### Behavioral Changes

> "This behavior change comes to terms, for example right now I'm walking and I'm trying to take a piss apparently, but I don't know where to take this piss. And I was just about to piss at a place that was socially, socially un-tolerated. Because I'm careless."

Alcohol impairs both motor skills and judgment. This is due to decreased activity in the frontal lobe, which is responsible for decision-making and social behavior. Incidents like almost urinating in an inappropriate place illustrate a compromise in social norms and motor planning.

## The Energetic and Cognitive Paradox

> "There is clearly a high amount of energy being delivered to the brain, even if there is at the same time a numbing of the brain."

This high energy sensation can be attributed to increased dopamine levels, which are associated with pleasure and reward. However, the numbing effect is due to GABAergic activity, which dampens cognitive processes and motor functions.

> "I'm having a very intellectual conversation trying to reach a very high abstractional level using a certain level of openness that I would not in all cases have had because I was not so open."

Alcohol reduces the efficacy of the prefrontal cortex, which typically inhibits over-sharing. This decreased inhibition can lead to more open and abstract conversations, as experienced.

## Social Interactions

### Simplification of Attention

> "There is a certain simplicity in the affordances of my attention... I can see that my attention is being drawn to other people... This would entail exiting a specific conversation with a specific conversation partner and in some cases doing this in a skillful manner and in some cases facing some kind of awkwardness."

Simplification of attention is related to the narrowed focus that alcohol induces. The brain's executive functions, responsible for complex task management and social navigation, are compromised. This can result in a more straightforward but less nuanced engagement in social situations.

### Emotional and Social Bonding

> "For example, in the situation where you are at a new company event and people are clustering together in groups and forming social connections, there is an evaluation that this connection has been lasting forever for these guys, except the fact that it is completely new and you might just as well latch on to that connection..."

Alcohol facilitates social bonding by increasing oxytocin and reducing social anxiety. However, it's crucial to recognize that these bonds are often superficial and might not translate into long-term relationships.

## Personal and Societal Implications

### Defocusing on Long-term Goals

> "Being drunk also means to defocus on the future...There is a vast network in the brain that structures very high-level abstract and long-term processing of goals and motivations."

Alcohol decreases activity in the default mode network (DMN), involved in self-referential thoughts and future planning. This shift can make long-term goals seem less pressing, contributing to the "live in the moment" feeling.

## Practical Considerations

### Health Risks and Social Benefits

> "Because it is well known that alcohol is a high-calorie drink that will have an effect on your body mass and your fat deposits and furthermore have very detrimental effects in terms of cognition and stress and so on. Cancer, the list of things and problems with alcohol is well documented..."

Indeed, the risks associated with alcohol consumption are significant—ranging from liver disease to neurological impairments. Yet, moderate drinking is often argued to have social benefits, such as easing social interactions.

### Balanced Approach

> "The argument would be against this point that you should simply learn to be in a state where you are hanging very loose and you are very uninhibited from the get-go..."

Instead of relying on alcohol, adopting mindfulness practices can help achieve a state of ease and openness. Techniques such as meditation can increase one's baseline level of contentment and social fluency without the negative side effects of alcohol.

## Conclusion

In summary, while alcohol can temporarily decrease inhibitions and facilitate social bonding, it comes with significant risks. By understanding the cognitive and social effects of alcohol, one can make more informed choices about its use. For long-term well-being, exploring alternative methods such as mindfulness and social skill training may offer a healthier path to achieving similar benefits.
